# Simple_Image_Processing
A mini project carried out to perform simple tasks on images using Python

## Abstract:
In general, an image is treated as a multi-dimensional array (or a matrix), in which a pixel is represented by an array of three values corresponding to three color channels in the RGB color system. The way this program works is we mainly deal with the image in the converted form of a numpy matrix and conducting the required tasks means making corresponding changes on the array (e.g: flipping the image means inverting the matrix, changing brightness means increasing/decreasing the pixels' RGB values, etc...)
